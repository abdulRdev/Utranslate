Website description: 

 Hi! Welcome to Utranslate! Learning a language can often be confusing and difficult. There are times when you may need to know how to say a phrase in another language on the go. Although, common translators such as Google Translate may be able to give you quick answers, their responses are often at times inaccurate and not what you are looking for. These common translators are also unable to understand the contemporary language that is used such as slang. Try writing out some slang on a common translator and see for yourself. This is why Utranslate has been introduced!
 
Utranslate will allow you to have any phrase or word precisely translated in the language that you want. Furthermore, each user will also have the opportunity to help others out by translating their inquiries. This is all done through the Utranslate community. No more language barriers!
